* Nan Zhong
I'm a software engineer at [[https://digitalocean.com][DigitalOcean]], I've worked all across the stack, but ultimately my passion lies in building distributed systems and tools that enable developers to be more productive.

When I'm not in front of my computer, you will most likely find me behind my camera.
