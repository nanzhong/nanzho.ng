This repository holds my personal site. It makes use of [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg][emacs-love/weblorg]] to generate a static site from pages and blog posts written as org-mode files (and includes a brain dump from my org-roam notes).

** Dependencies
All dependencies needed are included in the dev shell from the included nix flake. Direnv can be used to streamline the process of getting into the dev shell.
