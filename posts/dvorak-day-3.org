#+TITLE: Dvorak - Day 3

It seems I've hit a wall with my DVORAK progress. I continued my approach of switching back and forth between my keyboard layouts, but I think for the past two days QWERTY typing continued to be full muscle memory, and DVORAK typing was simply getting a little better because I had better memorized the layout day after day.

QWERTY - *90* WPM
DVORAK - *30* WPM

Starting tomorrow, I'm going to try longer periods of DVORAK to see if I can start building some muscle memory; I'm going to try and use DVORAK entirely for the morning and, switch back to QWERTY in the afternoon if it's too much of a hindrance.
