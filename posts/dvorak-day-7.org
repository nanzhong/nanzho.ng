Another full day using DVORAK and I have to say thay my wrist problems that I wanted to solve are now gone. Although I'm not too sure whether it's due to switching layouts or the drop in raw typing speed, I guess I will find out as I continue to improve.

Starting today I will start posting progress updates every 10th day as my transitioning to DVORAK is more or less complete.

QWERTY - *60* WPM
DVORAK - *40* WPM
