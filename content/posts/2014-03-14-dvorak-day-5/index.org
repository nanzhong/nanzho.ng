I have not noticed any changes in my typing speeds today. The only observation of note is that as soon as I look at the keyboard when typing QWERTY, I instantly blank out and cannot remember where keys are supposed to be. I attribute this to still relying too heavily on memorization when typing DVORAK.

QWERTY - *60* WPM
DVORAK - *35* WPM
